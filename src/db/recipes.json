            "description": "This eggplant hash is a great replacement for the classic potato hash but made keto-friendly! Instead of potatoes, this is made with diced eggplant pieces, halloumi cheese, and onion! A sunny side up egg is placed on top of the hash and the egg yolk oozes out and pairs perfectly with the eggplant hash. A perfect combination of a soft yet crunchy breakfast due to the eggplant and onion."
